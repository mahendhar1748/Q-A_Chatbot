# Q-A_Chatbot

A Question-Answering (QA) Chatbot is an AI-powered tool that responds to user queries. Instead of giving general responses, it can be trained on specific documents (like PDFs, websites, or databases) to provide accurate and relevant answers.

ðŸ”¹ How Does It Work?
A QA chatbot typically follows these steps:

ðŸ”¸ User Inputs a Question
 The user types a question into the chatbot.
 
ðŸ”¸ Understanding the Question
 The chatbot uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT model (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) to process the question and determine what information is needed.
 
ðŸ”¸ Searching for Relevant Information
If the chatbot is only using OpenAI, it generates answers based on its pre-trained knowledge.
If you connect custom documents (like PDFs), the chatbot retrieves relevant data from them.

ðŸ”¸ Generating a Response
The chatbot uses AI to summarize and answer based on the retrieved information.
It provides a clear and accurate response to the user.

ðŸ”¸ Displaying the Answer
 The chatbot shows the response in an interface (like a website, app, or messaging platform).
